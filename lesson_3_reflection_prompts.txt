When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we are using different systems other than our personal system, when we are
working on a project where in multiple resources are working on that. In these cases 
we need to use our remote repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes we will be working on different branches/versions and we may be checking 
whether the code is working fine, before merging with others. So it is required to 
pull the needed version to work on manually rather than staying up-to-date with the
remote repository.

 
 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 
 Forks -used to get a copy of a project.(when we don't have permissions to commit on the project, we use fork to get a copy to our account and work on it) Forks work on github not on git
 Clones -used to make a copy from remote repository to local repository
 Branches -To create branch within the repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 This will help to know whether the local repository is in sync with the remote repository

 How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

 It would be very harder to collobrate without using git or github
