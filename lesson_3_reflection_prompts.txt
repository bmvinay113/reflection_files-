When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we are using different systems other than our personal system, when we are
working on a project where in multiple resources are working on that. In these cases 
we need to use our remote repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes we will be working on different branches/versions and we may be checking 
whether the code is working fine, before merging with others. So it is required to 
pull the needed version to work on manually rather than staying up-to-date with the
 remote repository.
